	User Interface (Also known as UI) Design consists of the concepts and ideas behind knowing and ensuring end-users can easily and efficiently operate and understand the interface. This includes the storyboarding/designing of a UI, creating prototypes of the UI, and seeking feedback at most stages with multiple potential end-users to ensure maximum performance quality.

	What formal training is available or required for User Interface Design & Development jobs?
	https://ca.indeed.com/User-Interface-Designer-jobs-in-Toronto,-ON
	
	
	Based on various ads for UID&D careers and jobs across the Internet, I've found the following skills and.or courses to be requirements/boons for the industry:
		1. University Degree or Certification in User Experience-related field
		2. 3+ years of UI/UE experience, 5+ preferred.
		3. Proficiencies in HTML5 & CSS
		4. Experience in Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator & Photoshop)
		
	As such, I'd look for University BCS in Computer Sciences, with specialization in UI/UE; Courses/Certifications in Adobe Creative Suite, Photoshop, or other high-level digital designing tools; and courses in HTML5 and CSS basics. Most of these courses (especially at colleges like NSCC!) can take 6-12 months worth of related courses, as well as work placements can help get the required/recommended experience in the industry.
